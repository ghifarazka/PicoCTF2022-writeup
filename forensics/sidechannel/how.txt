- make the pin_checker executable with chmod
- try putting in pins
- the more correct the pin, the longer it takes
- use "time -p ./pin_checker" command and read the "user" part to know how long 
the execution time is
- now brute from 00000000, 10000000, etc until 90000000... pick the one that stands
out (the longest one) in this case "4".
- keep going until you get 8 digit
- keep in mind it's asking for numbers because PIN means "Personal Identification 
NUMBER"
- the pin is 48390513
- use the pin to access master server
- get flag

- NOTE: i wish i could've scripted this, but i'm still struggling on how to pass
an argument to a prompt from a script.
