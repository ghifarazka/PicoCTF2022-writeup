# substitution1 (100 Pts)

### Description
> A second message has come in the mail, and it seems almost identical to the first one. Maybe the same thing will work again. Download the message here.

### Hints
- Try a frequency attack
- Do the punctuation and the individual words help you make any substitutions?

Using online tools like [dcode.fr](https://www.dcode.fr/monoalphabetic-substitution), we can find the substitution alphabet by decoding the message manually. From the previous challenge `substitution0`, we know that the ending will be "...the flag is: picoCTF{..." so start from then. We'll then reveal the letters in the text and then try filling it to make words that make sense in english.

flag: `picoCTF{FR3QU3NCY_4774CK5_4R3_C001_E57444AC}`
