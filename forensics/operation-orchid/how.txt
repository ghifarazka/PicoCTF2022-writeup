- open disk file > navigate to root folder > found flag.txt and flag.txt.enc
- turned out that flag.txt is a misleading (?) recovering it reveals what looks 
like a coordinate that leads to nowhere
- flag.txt.enc is an encrypted version of the flag, with salt (reminded of 
eavesdrop challenge)
- i put the contents using this command: 
icat -o 411648 disk.flag.img 1782 > file.txt
- now what digest (encryption method) i can use to decrypt it?
- do command: strings disk.flag.img | grep flag.txt
- it reveals as follow:
flag.txt
flag.txt.enc
touch flag.txt
nano flag.txt 
nano flag.txt 
openssl aes256 -salt -in flag.txt -out flag.txt.enc -k unbreakablepassword1234567
shred -u flag.txt
flag.txt
flag.txt
flag.txt.enc
flag.txt
flag.txt.enc
- this is the command used when encrypting the flag.
- now just edit it a bit so that it decrypts:
openssl aes256 -d -salt -in file.txt -out flag.txt -k unbreakablepassword1234567
- get flag (in flag.txt)

NOTE: grepping flag.txt is a VERY IMPORTANT thing to do in ctf, or if it's one of
those encrypted flags try grepping openssl
