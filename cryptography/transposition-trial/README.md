# transposition-trial (100 Pts)

### Description
> Our data got corrupted on the way here. Luckily, nothing got replaced, but every block of 3 got scrambled around! The first word seems to be three letters long, maybe you can use that to recover the rest of the message.

### Hints
- Split the message up into blocks of 3 and see how the first block is scrambled

I did this by hand. Separate the message into a block of 3 letters. Then rearrange the letters into something that make sense (e.g. heT -> The). Do the same for the rest of the blocks.
