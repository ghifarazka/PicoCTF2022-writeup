- open disk -> root -> .ssh -> first file (id_ed25519) is the private KEY
- icat it, then copy it in a file with the same name
- use the command ssh -i key_file -p 57355 ctf-player@saturn.picoctf.net
- change the key_file into the key file acquired before
- if "keys are too open..." -> chmod 400 file (make it only readable by me)
- logged in -> ls -> flag.txt
- get flag

- note: the disk is the same in every instances, only the port is different
