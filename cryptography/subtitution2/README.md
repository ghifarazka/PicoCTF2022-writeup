# substitution2 (100 Pts)

### Description
> It seems that another encrypted message has been intercepted. The encryptor seems to have learned their lesson though and now there isn't any punctuation! Can you still crack the cipher? Download the message here.

### Hints
- Try refining your frequency attack, maybe analyzing groups of letters would improve your results?

To solve this challenge, the procedure is exactly the same as the previous challenge `substitution1`, but this time with no punctuation.
